# 🕵️ Detective Academy: Field Manual

**Welcome to the Academy, Cadet.** 

This guide will teach you how to operate the Detective Academy interface, utilize the AI-powered forensic tools, and solve cases to rise through the ranks.

---

## 🎯 Objective
Your goal is to solve procedurally generated mystery cases by:
1.  **Analyzing Evidence**: Reviewing clues, witness statements, and crime scene visuals.
2.  **Finding Contradictions**: Spotting lies in suspect alibis.
3.  **Formulating Theories**: Writing detailed logical deductions to prove your case.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. The Dashboard
When you launch the application, you enter the Main Dashboard.
*   **Rank**: Your current title (starts at **Cadet**). As you solve cases, this will increase to **Investigator** and **Senior Detective**.
*   **Accuracy**: Your detective score (0-100%). Wrong guesses lower this score.
*   **Action**: Click **"Initialize New Case"** to let Gemini 3 generate a unique mystery for you.

## 🔍 The Investigation Interface
Once a case is active, the screen is divided into three critical zones:

### 1. The Scene (Visuals)
*   **Scene Viewer**: Displays the current location (e.g., "The Silent Gallery").
*   **Description**: Read the text below the image carefully. It often contains subtle details about the environment (e.g., "The window was forced from the *inside*").

### 2. Evidence Board (Left Panel)
*   **Clues**: A list of factual items found at the scene.
    *   *Physical*: Objects like weapons, fingerprints, or footprints.
    *   *Testimony*: Statements from witnesses.
*   **Tip**: Compare these clues against the Suspect Profiles.

### 3. Suspect Profiles (Right Column)
*   **Profiles**: Background info on each suspect (e.g., "Head of Security, large debt").
*   **Alibis**: Where they claim they were. **This is usually where the lie is.**

## 🛠️ Advanced Tools

### 📸 Forensic Scanner (Multimodal AI)
**Detective Academy allows you to bring outside evidence into the game.**

1.  **Find an Image**: If you have a photo that you think is relevant (or if you want to test the AI's vision), save it to your device.
    *   *Roleplay Tip*: You can sketch a "crime scene map" on paper, take a photo, and upload it!
2.  **Upload**: Click the **"Upload Evidence (Image)"** button in the Investigation Panel.
3.  **Analysis**: The Gemini 3 AI will analyze the image in the context of the current case and tell you if it spots anything suspicious or relevant.

### 🧠 The Deduction Engine
This is not a multiple-choice quiz. You must write your solution.

1.  **Locate the Text Box**: Labeled "Formulate Hypothesis".
2.  **Write Your Theory**: Be specific. Link the Suspect to the Clues.
    *   ❌ *Weak*: "It was Elena."
    *   ✅ *Strong*: "It was Elena because the 'dust on the vent' suggests entry from above, which matches her background as a former acrobat. The security guard's alibi is solid."
3.  **Submit**: Click **"Submit to Academy Engine"**.
4.  **Feedback**: The Game Master will grade your logic.
    *   **Success**: Case Closed! You gain XP and return to the lobby.
    *   **Failure**: You receive a hint (e.g., "You missed the timeline inconsistency"), and your accuracy drops. Try again!

## 🏆 Scoring & Ranks
*   **Cadet**: You face single-scene crimes with obvious physical clues.
*   **Investigator**: Introduces conflicting witness testimonies.
*   **Senior Detective**: Requires connecting clues from multiple angles; false leads are common.

**Good luck, Detective. The truth is waiting.**
